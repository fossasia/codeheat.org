For writing commit messages please adhere to the Commit style guidelines.
Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.
The pull request will not get merged until and unless the commits are squashed. In case there are multiple commits on the PR, the commit author needs to squash them and not the maintainers cherrypicking and merging squashes.

<b>Step 3: Submitting a PR</b>

Once a PR is opened, try and complete it within 2 weeks, or at least stay actively working on it. Inactivity for a long period may necessitate a closure of the PR. As mentioned earlier updates would be nice.
